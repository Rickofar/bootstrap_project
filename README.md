# bootstrap_project

This is a Ventis Class Project

This class project is designed for students to understand the workings of Bootstrap as a CSS Framework.

Students were made to select several websites samples and themes to replicate using HTML, CSS and JavaScript where necessary even though this class is purely for HTML & CSS only.

This Marketify Theme with the link below was choosen by a section of the class while other sections worked on other themes from other theme stores.

In this project, I improvised using my own customized icons where I couldn't replicate the SVGs used in the original theme. However, the aim is to ensure that the final result looks closely like the original theme.

All the animation were done with CSS only, unlike the original theme which were done with both CSS and JavaScript.

Thanks Ventis Academy!
